# Sample Task

Here is a sample task which simulates a real world problem which GMAG 
will be solving in the online landing page platform. The goal of this 
task is to deliver a working templating solution in SASS. This should
not take more then 5 hours.

The basic steps are:

1. Create Github account (if not existing)
2. Clone this Github repository and make it public
3. Use your favorite text editor to edit the files
4. Convert CSS to SCSS with SASS **variables** for **color** and **fonts**
5. Generate new index.html and styles.css using SASS in "sass_solution"
6. Generate a new color palette and generate new index.html and styles.css using SASS in "max_palette"
7. Commit changes to the cloned repository
8. **Send me link to the repository for testing**

## Deliverables
Link to cloned public github repository with:
1. base directory changed to use sass
2. sass_solution directory with new index.html and styles.css generated using SASS
3. max_palette directory with new index.html and styles.css generated using SASS using new color palette
